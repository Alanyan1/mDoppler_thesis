OS Dependencies:
Ubuntu:
 CPU only: (through pip)
  $ sudo apt-get install python-pip python-dev   # for Python 2.7
  $ pip install tensorflow      # Python 2.7; CPU support (no GPU support)
 Softmax linear regression example: 
  (MNIST, cross-entropy, softmax)
  https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r1.2/tensorflow/examples/tutorials/mnist/mnist_softmax.py

Windows:
 GPU support:
  -CUDAÂ® Toolkit 8.0. For details, see NVIDIA's documentation Ensure that you append the relevant
  Cuda pathnames to the %PATH% environment variable as described in the NVIDIA documentation.
  -The NVIDIA drivers associated with CUDA Toolkit 8.0.
  -cuDNN v5.1. For details, see NVIDIA's documentation. Note that cuDNN is typically installed in
  different location from the other CUDA DLLs. Ensure that you add the directory where you installed
  the cuDNN DLL to your %PATH% environment variable. 
  -GPU card with CUDA Compute Capability 3.0 or higher.
 Pip:
  -Python 3.5.x: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-352/
  -Ensure that pip is installed and accessible through the terminal (Pip is python's package manager)
  -C:\> pip3 install --upgrade tensorflow-gpu

MNIST dataset:
 load:
  from tensorflow.examples.tutorials.mnist import input_data
  mnist = input_data.read_data_sets("<Directory of mnist>", one_hot=True)
 show:
  batch_xs, batch_ys = mnist.train.next_batch(1)
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 
  xs = batch_xs.reshape(28,28)
  imgplot = plt.imshow(xs)
  plt.show()
